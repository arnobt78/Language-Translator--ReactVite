## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a typical structure for a React + Vite + TailwindCSS project. Your project may have a similar setup:

```
/Language-Translator--ReactVite
â”œâ”€â”€ public/               # Static assets
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # Reusable React components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx           # Main app entry
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.jsx          # Vite entry
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.css         # Tailwind and custom styles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...               # Other logic/utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js    # TailwindCSS config
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.js        # Vite config
â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation
```

## API Integration

This app uses the [MyMemory Translation API](https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php) to perform translations. The API is called with the userâ€™s input text, source, and target language codes. It returns the translated text in real time.

*No API key required for free usage, but check the [docs](https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php) for limitations and rate limits.*

---

## Usage Instructions

1. Select the source and target languages.
2. Enter or paste text into the input box.
3. Click the **Translate** button.
4. Instantly see the translation below.
5. Use the **Reverse** button to swap languages and translate in the opposite direction.

---

## Component Walkthrough

**Main Components:**
- `App.jsx`: Main container, manages state and layout.
- `LanguageSelector.jsx`: Dropdown for language selection.
- `TranslatorForm.jsx`: Handles user input and submit actions.
- `TranslationResult.jsx`: Displays the translated output.

**Example (pseudo-code):**
```jsx
// App.jsx (simplified)
import LanguageSelector from './components/LanguageSelector';
import TranslatorForm from './components/TranslatorForm';

function App() {
  // state: inputText, sourceLang, targetLang, translatedText
  return (
    <>
      <LanguageSelector ... />
      <TranslatorForm ... />
      <TranslationResult ... />
    </>
  );
}
```

---

## Example Code Snippets

**Fetching translation from MyMemory:**
```js
const fetchTranslation = async (text, sourceLang, targetLang) => {
  const url = `https://api.mymemory.translated.net/get?q=${encodeURIComponent(text)}&langpair=${sourceLang}|${targetLang}`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.responseData.translatedText;
};
```

**TailwindCSS Usage Example:**
```jsx
<button className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
  Translate
</button>
```
